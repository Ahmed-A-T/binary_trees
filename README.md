# 0x1D C - Binary trees ✏️
At the end of this project, We were able to undesrtand these questions:
* What is a binary tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
## Tasks ✔️
0. Function that creates a binary tree node
